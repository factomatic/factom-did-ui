    <p>The Factom Decentralized Identifier (DID) registrar is a UI, which walks you through the steps of creating a digital identity.</p>
    <p>The basic digital identity you are about to create consists of a single public/private key pair, which will allow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you to sign messages</li>
      <li>anyone else to authenticate that a message has been signed by your digital identity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The public key of the digital identity will be recorded on the Factom blockchain and can be used by anyone trying to authenticate a signed message coming from you. <strong>The private key will be recorded in an encrypted file that you must download and keep safely stored. It will allow you to sign messages with your digital identity.</strong>.</p>
    <p>You are now ready to start! Make sure to keep an eye for the  <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> tooltips along the way, as they will guide you through the procedure.</p>
