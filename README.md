# Factom DID Registrar UI

This project contains the source code for the Factom Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) registrar UI. [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) are an emerging
W3C Community Standard for digital identities, adopted by [multiple blockchains](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/). The DID registrar enables the creation of
DID documents and uses [Factom](https://www.factomprotocol.org/) to record the public metadata for the identity on-chain.

The implementation of the registrar follows the specification, available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6IPOsANXmvGY1xmzXiWVRD8O5AVCFTBFBHcmU2WCZo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `ng build --prod` for a production build.

## Deployments

A live version on the Factom testnet is available at [https://factomatic.github.io/factom-did-ui](https://factomatic.github.io/factom-did-ui).
